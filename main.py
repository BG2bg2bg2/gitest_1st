#Hi



# Make a dictionary that stores items

# Make a function for the inventory 

# Ask user if they want to store anything or change anything or quit
    
    #if the user choose to store anything 
        # user can collect items or buy weapons, potions, charms, and key for gates
    
    #if the user choose to change anything ask what they want to change
        # user can set a soul free or use/drop an item
        
            # if user choose set a soul free user can decided what soul they want to choose
            # if user choose to use/drop an item user can decided what item they want to use/drop
        
    # if user choose to quit the inventory will quit and user can continue with the game
